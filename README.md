# Talk-to-Podcasts

An app that enables voice conversations with podcasts (or any .mp3 file) using an AI voice assistant. I created it to help people who have pressing questions while listening to podcasts in situations where they can't use their hands. The project uses EdgeDB for authentication and saving users' uploaded podcast data.
